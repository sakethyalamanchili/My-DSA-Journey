### **Progress Log**

- **12/07/2025** – Set up virtual environment, added `requirements.txt`, refreshed Python fundamentals, and practiced core data structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples).
- **12/08/2025** – Completed hands-on exercises with Lists and continued revising Python basics, including Functions, Lambda expressions, Map, and Filter operations.
- **12/09/2025** – Reviewed Flowcharts, Pseudocode, and structured problem-solving steps. Practiced these concepts by implementing two coding exercises: **Square of side N** and **Hollow Square of side N**.
Here’s a **short, clean, and README-ready** version of your workflow update. I’ve kept it **simple, structured, and professional**.
- **12/10/2025 – 12/11/2025** – Holiday break.
- **12/12/2025** – Practiced pattern-based problems using loops and conditional logic. Implemented and analyzed the following patterns:

  * Square
  * Hollow Square
  * Rectangle
  * Right Triangle
  * Inverted Triangle
  * Pyramid
  * Inverted Pyramid
  * Number Triangle
  * Floyd’s Triangle

Focused on understanding **row–column logic, spacing patterns, and step-by-step problem breakdown**.
