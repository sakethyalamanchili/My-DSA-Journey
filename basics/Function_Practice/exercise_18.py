Problem: Distance covered by a Vehicle

Description:
    You are given the speed of a vehicle and the time it has traveled. 
    Your task is to compute and return the distance traveled by the vehicle.

    Formula: Distance = Speed * Time

Input Parameters:
    speed (float): The speed of the vehicle.
    time (float): The time the vehicle has traveled.

Output:
    float: The calculated distance covered.

Examples:
    Input: speed = 60, time = 2
    Output: 120.0

    Input: speed = 50.5, time = 1.5
    Output: 75.75
